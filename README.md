# spaceSim
So I made a physics simulation
I couldnt come up with a good name for the things so I'm just calling them bodies (like celestial bodies) 

## Controls:
+ WASD or Arrow Keys to move around the map
+ Scroll to zoom
+ Click to spawn
+ Click and Hold to Charge
+ Escape to pause
+ R to recenter the camera
+ I to show velocity indicators
+ O to show coordinates of bodies
+ P to show mass, velocity, and diameter of bodies

## Settings
+ Gravity Strength ranges from 0 to 5
+ Simulation Speed ranges from 0.1 to 3

### Other Info
+ Bodies cap at 1000
+ Max zoom 5, min zoom 0.1
+ More bodies will impact performance
  
I had fun making this so I hope you enjoy messing around with it :)
